**The Big Idea and Explanation**

The core message is that the real danger of AI isn't that it might become too intelligent and overpower humanity, but that it's already deeply integrated into our lives despite being "stupid" or lacking common sense. This lack of intelligence leads AI systems to make poor decisions, causing potential harm. The focus should be on improving AI's intelligence to mitigate these risks.

**What Was the Conversation All About?**
The conversation on the *Machine Learning Street Talk* podcast with Professor Pedro Domingos revolves around the current state of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly addressing the misconception that the primary risk of AI is its potential to become too smart. Professor Domingos argues that the real issue is AI's current "stupidity"â€”its lack of common sense and poor decision-making abilities. The discussion highlights the need for better AI systems that can enhance societal intelligence rather than exacerbate problems due to their limitations.

**Who Is Professor Pedro Domingos?**
Professor Pedro Domingos is a renowned AI researcher and professor of computer science, known for his extensive work in machine learning and contributions to the development of AI technologies. He has authored influential books, such as *The Master Algorithm*, that aim to make AI understandable to the general public, focusing on the societal implications of AI and the dangers posed by AI systems that are not yet smart enough.


**Technical Terms made simple**
1. **Stochastic Parrot**: A derogatory term sometimes used to describe AI models like large language models (LLMs) that generate text without understanding. Domingos argues against this term, emphasizing that AI models are designed to generalize from data, not just mimic it.
2. **Generalization**: The ability of an AI model to apply what it has learned from training data to new, unseen situations. Poor generalization means the AI struggles with new contexts outside its training data.
3. **Objective Function**: The mathematical formula or criteria that guides an AI system's decisions. Domingos suggests that if there's a problem with AI, it should be with the objective function guiding its actions, not the AI itself.
4. **Neurosymbolic AI**: A field of AI that combines neural networks (used in deep learning) with symbolic reasoning, aiming to create systems that can both learn from data and reason like humans. Domingos mentions this as a promising direction for AI development.

**Other Important Ideas ðŸ’¡**
1. **AI Making Bad Decisions**: "Computers are making bad decisions every day because they have no common sense. It's a model, for crying out loud. It learned from that data. It doesn't know anything."
2. **Trust Over Transparency**: "Transparency is just a proxy for trust. What is really important is that I trust the AI. I trust Tylenol, I trust 'Prezibot' [AI overlord]."
3. **The Need to Improve AI**: "The way you make the computer safe, transparent, explainable, reliable, all of these things is by speeding up the progress of AI, not slowing it down."
4. **AI in Social Media**: "Twitter and Facebook are basically an AI system choosing what everybody sees. And it is incredibly powerful. And right now it's very dumb precisely because in contrast to Inside Out, it just has one objective function which is maximize engagement."
5. **Regulating AI**: "Trying to regulate AI is like trying to regulate mathematics... what needs to be regulated is not AI, quantum mechanics, or Python. It's the specific applications."
